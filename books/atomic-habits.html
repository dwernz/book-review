        <ul class="book-key-lessons"><strong>Key Lessons:</strong>
            <li><strong>The 1% Rule:</strong> Small, consistent improvements (even 1% better each day) lead to significant
                results over time, thanks to the power of compounding.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Systems over Goals:</strong> Goals are about outcomes, while systems are the processes you
                follow to achieve those goals. Create a system that supports your desired habits.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity Change:</strong> Your habits shape your identity. By focusing on becoming the type of person
                who has good habits, positive change becomes natural.</li>
            <li><strong>The Habit Loop:</strong> Understand the four-step cycle of cue, craving, response, and reward that
                drives habits. Use this knowledge to design habits that stick.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Habits Obvious:</strong> Create a physical environment that cues desired behaviors and hides temptations.</li>
            <li><strong>Habit Stacking:</strong> Link new habits to existing routines to make them easier to adopt.</li>
            <li><strong>Temptation Bundling:</strong> Pair an undesired habit with a desired one to make the unwanted behavior less appealing.</li>
            <li><strong>The 2-Minute Rule:</strong> Lower the barrier to entry for new habits by making them incredibly easy to start (e.g., floss for 2 minutes).</li>
            <li><strong>The Goldilocks Rule:</strong> Find the "just right" challenge level for your habits to maximize motivation and avoid burnout.</li>
        </ul>
