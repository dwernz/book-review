                <li><strong>Law of Value:</strong> Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.</li>

                <li><strong>Law of Influence:</strong> Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people's interests first.</li>
                <li><strong>Law of Authenticity:</strong> The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Law of Receptivity:</strong> The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.</li>
