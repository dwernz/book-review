            <li><strong>The Marshmallow Experiment:</strong> The book draws on the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment, where children were given a choice between eating one marshmallow immediately or waiting for a chance to receive two marshmallows. Those who delayed gratification exhibited greater success markers later in life.</li>
            <li><strong>Delayed Gratification for Long-Term Success:</strong> The book argues that the ability to resist short-term temptations and focus on long-term goals is a crucial skill for personal and professional achievement.</li>
            <li><strong>Building Self-Control:</strong>Don't Eat the Marshmallow...Yet! offers strategies for developing self-control, including:</li>

                <li><strong>Developing Habits:</strong>Creating consistent habits that align with your goals strengthens your self-control over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualization:</strong>Imagine yourself achieving your long-term goals to stay motivated and resist immediate temptations.</li>
                <li><strong>Reward Systems:</strong>Establish a system for rewarding yourself after successfully delaying gratification.</li>
            </ul>
