        <ul class="book-key-lessons"><strong>Key Lessons:</strong>
            <li><strong>The Two Dads:</strong> The book uses the story of Kiyosaki's relationships with his biological father ("poor dad") and his friend's father (rich dad") to illustrate contrasting views on money and wealth creation.</li>
            <li><strong>Rat Race vs. Financial Freedom:</strong> Rich Dad Poor Dad criticizes the traditional "get a good job, work hard, save money" approach, arguing it keeps people trapped in a cycle of debt and limited financial options. The book emphasizes building assets that generate income (financial freedom).</li>
            <li><strong>The Cashflow Quadrant:</strong> Kiyosaki introduces the Cashflow Quadrant, dividing business models into four categories (Employee - E, Self-Employed - S, Business Owner - B, Investor - I) and highlights the B & I quadrants for wealth building through businesses and investments that generate passive income.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Education:</strong> The book stresses the importance of financial literacy for navigating the modern economic landscape and making informed investment decisions.</li>
